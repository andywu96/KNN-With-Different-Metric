## KNN-With-Different-Metric

This is one of the HW assignment at USC, using KNN with different metrics to find the best test and train error.

1. Pre-Processing and Exploratory data analysis
2. k-nearest neighbors with Euclidean metric
3. Find a Learning Curve
4. KNN with different distance metrics
   - Manhattan Distance
   - Chebyshev Distance   
   - Mahalanobis Distance
5. Weighted distances
